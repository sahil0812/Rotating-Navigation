            <p>cat, (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat, domesticated member of the family Felidae,
                order Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. Like all felids, domestic cats are
                characterized by supple low-slung bodies, finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and
                specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting. Cats possess other
                features of their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, and
                finely coordinated in movement.</p>
            <h3>Lala The Cat</h3>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/f7/fa/45f7faa2418cb45408d33a14eee11620.jpg" alt="lala">
            <p>Lala is a Napoleon Munchkin cat with a long white fur coat. She may look similar to Coco but the two
                aren’t identical. Lala has bright blue eyes and a black blotch on her nose while Coco doesn’t and like a
                Munchkin, she also has short legs, and she tends to stick her tail straight up. Her tail is also a lot
                fluffier than Coco's. Lala also has 2 fur patches on both of her eyes which when she faces forward, she
                looks angry.Lala, like Lulu, is a very mischievous cat. She is hungry most of the time and even runs to
                quickly get the food. She also hates to be bathed, always trying to run away and meowing very loudly.
                She is also very close to DD, often following and copying what the older cat does. It is hinted that
                Lala prefers to be groomed by other cats, mostly DD, or at times, Lulu.</p>
